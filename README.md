# Overview
My goal is to be a bioinformaticist and a big part of that is utilizing machine learning and data cleansing tools like pandas.
The dataset I am using was provided by a faculty member at a university and it is a private dataset so I can't share the link here.
I wanted to write this software to see how I could set up a function to manipulate the data and see how well the ML tools still worked.

# Data Analysis Results
I wanted to reduce the precision of the dataset and see how well the model performed. This took a lot of effort and so I just have the baseline setup for it at this point.

# Development Environment
I used several python libraries including pandas, sklearn, os, and dotenv. I developed in the VSCode editor.

# Useful Websites
* [Pandas Docs](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/)
* [SK Learn Docs](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

# Future Work
* Start reducing precision to see how it affects the model.
* Reduce the amount of features being used and see how it affects the model.
